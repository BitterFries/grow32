#grow32

grow32 is an open source project to build a monitoring and watering system for gardens and greenhouses based on an ESP32.
It allows monitoring of up to five temperature probes, two soil moisture probes, one air humidity probe, the water level of the reservoir, the battery voltage of the power supply, and the flow rate of the water pump.
The system can control the pump for watering and notify when measurements are outside a given threshold.
